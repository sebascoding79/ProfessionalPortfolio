        <p>I am a Software Engineer II working at UKG and a graduate student at FAU studying Data Science and
        Analytics</p>
        <p>In the workplace I keep a positive attitude and try to learn as much as I can from my peers and from the
        different stories that I tackle on a weekly basis</p>
        <p>Outside of work, I enjoy taking long walks in the evenings to clear my mind of the madness of the everyday
        life, I enjoy spending time with my family and my dogs and try to keep up with the different shows I watch
        (if time permits of course).</p>

          <p>Firstly, it's important to understand the problem, especially the business aspect
          so the customer always comes up on the winning end so I like asking questions and
          figuring the outcomes to edge cases and common scenarios</p>

        <h4 class="mb-4">Design and Plan</h4>
        <p>So now that I understand the problem and what is the expected outcome, I like to
        focus on the software development point of view and answering questions like: Are we
        adding a new table? What new objects could we be making? Are we toucing current functionality.
        I am not afraid to ask for second opinions from architects or lead engineers to make the best choice and I
        learn something new along the way</p>

        <h4 class="mb-4">Execute</h4>
        <p>The coding challenge begins here and once that part is done, I love presenting what I have done to my peers
        and business analysts to confirm the outcome of the added code and put my pull request out for revision
        During that time I figure out if I need to reach out to Site Reliability Engineers if we are updating tables
        in the database or need to schedule an emergency deployment to staging or production.</p>
